# CaesarsSalad
This tool was written for a capture the flag event. Though there are many online tools out there like it, I felt it would be good practice to create a tool like this. 

## **What it does**
Simply put, the program takes a users input, and attempts to shift it 26 spaces, equal to the number of characters in the alphabet. It will print all possible outcomes, and if Caesar Cipher is being used one result should appear legible.
